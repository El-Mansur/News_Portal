# News Portal — Neшs
###### Project Description

Neшs Portal is an online communication medium for internet users which are read all over the country. And that is how our project is going to prevent such a problem as a poor number of honest and non-corrupt news portals in Kazakhstan.
#
###### Project Scope

Our project time duration is one year. We are planning to publish publications, press releases, columns, articles, blogs and other news related content. 
#
###### User-interface

A Web user interface allows the user to interact with content or software running on a remote server through a Web browser. This interaction involves using search, getting past ads, and scrolling navigation, all of which has an effect on their likelihood to return, recommend, and trust these sources of news. Which is why we are choosing the WEB UI.
#
###### Programming Language & Database server
##### PL - C#      
C# is quite flexible and handy, especially when it comes to web development. 


##### DS - SQLite or mySQL
We're not sure about this yet, but will probably be choosing between SQLite and mySQL.
#
###### Dataset
The data set we are choosing for the project is ["All the news"](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news). The following dataset consists of 143,000 articles from 15 American publications 3 files and 30 columns, and it suits great for our news portal. The amount of tables is enough to follow the project instructions.

##### Content

articles1.csv - 50,000 news articles (Articles 1-50,000)

articles2.csv - 49,999 news articles (Articles 50,001-100,00)
